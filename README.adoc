Toggles fullscreen mode when either the kbd:[f] or kbd:[F11] key is pressed in a http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js[Bespoke.js] presentation.
Delegates to the native fullscreen mechanism of the browser.

TIP: If you have form elements in your slides, use the https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-forms[bespoke-forms] plugin to prevent the fullscreen toggle from being triggered when typing kbd:[f] inside a form input or editable region.
